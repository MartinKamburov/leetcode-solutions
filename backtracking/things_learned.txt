Combinations definition: is a way of selecting items from a collections, such that
(unlike permutations) the order of selection does not matter. **Order does not matter**
    - Example: 
        - set: [1, 2, 3]
        - combinations of set are: [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3]
    - Combinations are basically lazy permutations. They care about who is in the group,
      but they don't care where they sit.
    - Another example:
        - Picking three people to be on a planning committee. If you swap their
        seats, it's still the exact same committee.

Permutation definition: permutation relates to the act of arranging all the 
members of a set into some sequence or order. **Order Matters**
    - Example: 
        - set: [1, 2, 3]
        - permutations of set are: [[1,2,3], [1,3,2], [3,1,2], [3,2,1]]
    - Another example:
        - Picking a President, Vice President, and Secretary. If you swap their roles, it's a different arrangement.
